        p.mt0 I'm a digital product designer and developer. I'm obsessed with merging tech and creative in unexpected ways. 
        p I moved to Burlington, VT to attend Champlain College. While there I founded Fractor with my business partner in Boston, MA. We worked with startups like Barnes Mcqueen Publishing Resources, Champlain College Publishing Initiative, Burlington City Arts, and many more. After college I interned at Solidarity of Unbridled Labour as their interactive media intern. During this time I collaborated with Mamava. After my term at Solidarity, I joined daftlabs to build and grow their creative department. There I've teamed up with extremely talented developers to overhaul the product workflow. 
        p I love what I do, and look forward to where life will take me next.
