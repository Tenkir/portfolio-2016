      p Grovehub is a platform for brands to create branded educational seminars. It was created as part of DaftLabs' internal incubtor by a team of engineers, who focused on creating a technically great product. Once Grovehub began aquiring customers, we decided it was time to bring the interface and branding up to the level of its tech.

          | Review
      p We began by taking a close look at current interface, and determining what the obvious issues where. We knew there where many issues with the current system, which had been put together feature-by-feature, so we asked ourselves, "Where did we get confused when navigating the interface?" If we where getting lost, surely our users where as well. After internal review, we met with many of our current Grovehub users to discuss what issues they had found with the interface. After reviewing our current interface through internal testing and talking to current customers, we set out to see how new users used the product. We presented the current Grovehub interface to a group of new users and gave them tasks to complete.

          | Discovery
      p When we gave users specific tasks and asked to complete them, they spent many minutes clicking aimlessly around the interface before finding the correct button. Users where most confused when first creating an account and being shown a blank screen with no direction on what to do next. The lack of direction combined with the lack of empty states caused users to be unsure of the next action they where supposed to complete. In addition, because of the in-page admin panel, the interface suffered from a lack of context between what the admins saw, and what their users would see.
      p We also recieved many comments about the Grovehub branding. Users commented that the Grovehub branding was so dark and strong, they worried about difficulties overriding the colors with their own branding.

          | Recommendations
      p After testing and talking to users, we made recommondations. Rather than maintain the in-page editing that has caused confusion among users, we decided to create a separate area of the site where admins could create and manage their branded sites. Once changes have been made within the dashboard, admins will then be able to view their website as either logged in seminar viewers, presenters, or logged out users. This will allow users to better contextualize what area of the interface they are currently engaged with, and alleviate confusion caused by the current editing system.
      p We also recommended the creation of meaningful empty states for dashboard areas which do not yet have content. This was to reinforce desired actions, as well as inform users of the fact that something will occupy the space after said action is performed.
      p As for the branding, we recommended replacing the current Grovehub branding with a new logo, color pallet, and typeface. The new brand language would create a product where the branding falls away and allows the user to easily customize it to suit their brand.
